  - title: "Noise"
    desc: >
      Noise is the bread and butter of ambient, and the package provides a long
      range of different noise functions, both for creating matrices and arrays
      of noise and for taking full control with the tidy interface.
    contents:
      - gen_perlin
      - gen_simplex
      - gen_worley
      - gen_cubic
      - gen_value
      - gen_white
      - noise_blue
  - title: "Patterns"
    desc: >
      Pattern generators are useful for modifying noise values and get
      interesting effects, such as marble, and wood rings.
    contents:
      - gen_spheres
      - gen_waves
      - gen_checkerboard
  - title: "Noise modifiers"
    desc: >
      The raw noise values are not the end of it. ambient provides a range of
      functions to either modify the input, output or the generators themselves
      for new effects such as fractal noise.
    contents:
      - fracture
      - fbm
      - billow
      - ridged
      - clamped
      - curl_noise
      - gradient_noise
      - trans_affine
      - blend
  - title: "Utilities"
    desc: >
      While ambient is mostly about generating noise patterns it does come with
      a few utilities, wrapped around the long_grid class, which make it easy
      to work flexibly with the generated values
    contents:
      - long_grid
      - ambient-package
